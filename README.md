## Deployment
The front-end of this application uses ReactJS as a framwork to quicly have our Javscript application up and running. Best practices is used in naming variables and components. Below are technologies use in the front-end.

### Vercel
Vercel is the most accessible platform to deploy websites. By connecting the ** your GitHub repository** to Vercel, you can simply deploy the main branch to Vercel domains â€” and it does all the heavy lifting for you. **(Julian Wallis)**

This code we got help with a token and also in office hours. To make the page function live, without needing to refresh the page after making a change.
```
      async function onSubmit(e) {
        console.log(setTopics)
        e.preventDefault();
        const newTopic = { ...form };

       const update = await axios.post(`http://localhost:4000/api/topics`, newTopic);
       setForm({ topic: "", comments: "", image: "" });
       navigate("/");

       }
```

### Testing
-If you are able to see crud functionality ,and the data changes. Then the app is functional.

### Front-end planning

December 9th
We are building out our front end today. Yesterday we were able to deploy the front-end and back-end while also displaying data.

Today we are making the front page look nicer and building out the routes. Max and Humza are working on the front end routes and dsign right now. While I work with Postman to make sure our data nicer on the API. Before lunch we will plan how to attach the CRUD functionality to the buttons as well

December 10th
Dividing up our roles. Max is looking up some UX features and how to make our app look nicer. Jeffrey is working on the CRUD functionality to work on the page, with assistance from Humza. 


December 11th
Questions - Allow changes to happen live, without refreshing the page.
We also want the comments to be an array, so that we can add and delete comments in the array.
