### Front-end planning

December 9th
We are building out our front end today. Yesterday we were able to deploy the front-end and back-end while also displaying data.

Today we are making the front page look nicer and building out the routes. Max and Humza are working on the front end routes and dsign right now. While I work with Postman to make sure our data nicer on the API. Before lunch we will plan how to attach the CRUD functionality to the buttons as well
